/*
7. Create a queue class using Doubly linked List
Use the items listed in #6 and enqueue them to your queue.
Check to see who is first one on the Queue?
*/

/*
8. Queue implementation using a stack
There are many ways to implement a queue. 
You have learned using singly linked list, 
and doubly linked list. Keeping the concept of a queue in mind, 
implement a queue using 2 stacks and no other data structure. 
(You are not allowed to use a doubly linked list or array. 
Use your stack implementation 
with a linked list from above to solve this problem.)

9. Square dance pairing
As people come to the dance floor, they should be paired off as quickly as possible: man with woman, man with woman, all the way down the line. If several men arrive in a row, they should be paired in the order they came, and likewise if several women do. Maintain a queue of "spares" (men for whom you have no women yet, or vice versa), and pair them as appropriate.

10. The Ophidian Bank
At the Ophidian Bank, a single teller serves a long queue of people. 
New customers join the end of the queue, 
and the teller will serve a customer only if they have all of the 
appropriate paperwork. Write a representation of this queue; 
25% of the time (random), a customer's paperwork isn't quite right, 
and it's back to the end of the queue. Show what a few minutes of the bank's lobby 
would look like.
